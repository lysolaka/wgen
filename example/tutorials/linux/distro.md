# Choosing your distro

Always remember to stay open minded, don't blindly follow tutorials, think for yourself. If you do this 
any distro is good for you.

Below is my short distro history:
1. Garuda Linux (3 months)
2. Arch Linux (6 months)
3. Gentoo Linux (2 years as of writing this)

# Arch-based distros

They are a very good starting point in my opinion, as you learn Linux, while using a popular enough 
ecosystem to find a lot of helpful people online.

# The biggest tip

Avoid the so-called distrohopping, don't listen to Linux bros, think for yourself.
