# Following online tutorials

When it comes to Linux never blindly follow online tutorials. Your first place of choice would be 
your distribution's wiki and then the forums.

Of cource you can read tutorials elsewhere, but remember that a lot of people make assumptions 
about system configurations or they're biased towards certain distros (Arch BTW).
