# WGEN

`wgen` is a very "limited" static website generator built in Rust. In fact this website was built using it.

## The motivation

As I like to reinvent the wheel, I present to you a static website generator. 
For now it is very limited (actually as of now it does not function yet), 
but I want this project to naturally grow by making generic ways to accomplish the things I want.

## The language

I chose Rust because it is my language of choice. A project like this should really 
be done using Python, but I like the challenge and the feeling of "safety" that 
Rust brings.

Also programming (or rather scripting) in Python is annoying, even more than some may 
think. Whereas in Rust, if it compiles it usually works... Unless you made some logic 
mistakes.
