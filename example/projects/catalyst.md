# Replace catalyst

Gentoo's catalyst build script is very powerful and may I say the backbone of all Gentoo systems. 
It has some very annoying problems, and on top of that it is written in Python.

# The difficulties

I don't know anything about catalyst at all and that's the main barrier to start this project. 
I would also need to read a whole bunch of Python code to understand what it does, and learn 
how to cross compile because that's what catalyst does too.

As of now the project is just an idea, but if it ever starts, you know I will write it in Rust.
